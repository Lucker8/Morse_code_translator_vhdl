2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_i_1__1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_i_1__2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1__0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port c_led expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
