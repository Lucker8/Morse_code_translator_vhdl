2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_i_1__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_i_1__1/O, cell fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_i_1__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fifo_oled/fifo/inputsignal0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fifo_oled/fifo/inputsignal_reg_i_1/O, cell fifo_oled/fifo/inputsignal_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fifo_oled/fifo/outputsignal0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fifo_oled/fifo/outputsignal_reg_i_1/O, cell fifo_oled/fifo/outputsignal_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_i_1__2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_i_1__2/O, cell fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_i_1__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1/O, cell ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ti/dit_in/p_2_out[11] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ti/dit_in/cali2_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell ti/dit_in/cali2_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ti/dit_in/p_3_out[11] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ti/dit_in/cali3_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell ti/dit_in/cali3_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ti/dit_in/p_4_out[11] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ti/dit_in/temp_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell ti/dit_in/temp_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1__0/O, cell ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_i_1__1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
fifo_oled/db_reset/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_i_1__2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
fifo_oled/oled/print/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ti/dit_in/debouncer1/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_i_1__0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ti/dit_in/signal_debouncer1/FF3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port c_led expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
