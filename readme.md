#SPRO 4 @ SDU, Denmark


This project is based around the use of the ZedBoard FPGA using the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC.

The basic idea is to translate a morse code light input and transalate it into ASCii that is then shown on the OLED.
The project uses PMOD ADC with a photodiode connected to it.

Only the english alphabet is supported.
